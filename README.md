# PlaylistWeb
my Playlist Web Project with React 

This is playlist web with React 
and this will show the playlist I want to share. 

I can think of two sides: 
- user: Only seeing playlist
- owner: Setting playlist

# User
For user, only feature is only seeing the web owner's playlist for now 

# Owner 
For owner, they can set and modify the playlist they created. 
For now, it's only one playlist. 

# Feature 
For user side: 
- only see 

For Owner side: 
- create playlist (name, song, and tag) 
- change playlist (name, song, and tag) + add
- delete playlist (delete all info) 
- share the link 

# Concern
For other side: 
- need to think how to identify if the user is user or owner 
- DB

# Brain Storming..!
